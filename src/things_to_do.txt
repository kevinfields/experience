ideally I'd like to make it so every skill can be trained at 3 areas, 
only one of which can be accessed at level 1, one of which can be accessed around level 10-12, 
and the last at level 17-18.

Things should connect as much as possible, like growing lemons with farming making it 
easier to train early medicine, carrots from farming and meat from hunting should work with
cooking, logs from fitness (chopping wood) allow for construction, hunting could also give items
for crafting, cooking could give items for medicine, and medicine could give items for fitness.

Items gained from a 10-12 tier activity should be useful for any tier, but items
from a level 1 tier should only be possibly useful for other tier 1 and tier 10-12 activities.
Tier 17-18 should probably avoid giving items for tier 1 activities, but can give for 
tier 10-12. The loop should be circular, a major todo is going to be figuring out how to connect 
items so all skill training is balanced.
